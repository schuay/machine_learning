* No datasets with < 1k samples: small enough, but not too small.

Twitter:
        - large
        - familiar to us
        - very different from other sets
        - many attributes
        - text classification
        - no real or integer attributes
        - no missing values
Annealing:
        - different from twitter data set
        - categorical, real and integer attributes
        - few instances
        - fewer attributes
        - missing values
Solar Flares:
        - space!
        - only categorical attributes
Household Power Consumption:
        - real values
        - very large, yet few attributes

	- days when added as weekdays (one feature per weekday) result in very bad predictions unless the training set contains more than a week

* try different train/eval splits, also splitting on features.
* check effects of preprocessing.
* try random splits
* deal with missing values (mean, random, nearest neighbor, remove sample)

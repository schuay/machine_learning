  and python-sklearn on Debian. Help is also available at
  http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html.

Configuration
-------------

Classifiers and ensembles are specified using configuration files. A range
of examples are available in the conf/ subdirectory. conf/default.conf is
commented and used as testing setup for this project.

Running the experiments
-----------------------

Classifiers are evaluated using ensemble.py. Run

$ ./ensemble.py -h

for a list of available options. An example call using an alternative
configuration, verbose output, and the 'iris' dataset would be:

$ ./ensemble.py -c conf/mix.conf -d iris -v
